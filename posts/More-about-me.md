### Hello there! I'm **Adriana Borjas**, petroleum engineer and frontend developer... What a strange mix don't you think?

Surely when you relate engineering to web development, you think of systems and computing as related careers, perhaps you will add others to the list such as electronics, but petroleum?

Well, as you think, I have not found much affinity for itüòÖ However, the study of engineering (regardless of the area you choose) enables you to solve problems, through logical thinking and analyzing all the factors to consider, and **this** wonder is what you can apply day by day, in each area and in life itself.

You might wonder, how does a petroleum engineer end up **wanting** to be a Frontend developer?

Well, many factors influence. In **my case** it wasn't clear to me the engineering area in which I wanted to work at the beginning of my university studies. 
 
Also living in a country whose economy crumbles day by day and the wages in companies where you can get a job are not enough. Transnational companies are constantly struggling to get permission to continue working in this country, it is very difficult to enter if you don't have a good contact. 
 
After graduating, I had to face this bunch of problems that made me reconsider what I want for my future and what I can do to achieve it.

The situation of the country not only affects you economically, it does in **everything**, although you try in every possible way to avoid it. 

Many families, like mine, have separated because each member seeks the comfort and well-being that here (even though I keep trying every day) we cannot find. 

There is where you think, if what I have done so far has not worked, then I must change it, but this time I know more about what I want ... I want a job that allows me to cover the basic needs of my family, that allows me to visit my brothers who are spread throughout the world, that I can work from home or from anywhere, and then you already know how it ended üòù

Studying engineering changed my life in many ways, it changed my way of thinking, acting and put in my way many valuable people who have brought many good things to my life, among them I found an incredible **Full Stack Developer**, who is my friend, and my life partner and now also my guide in the world of web development. 

I was also very fortunate to obtain a **PLATZI** scholarship, which I took advantage of for a year. What courses did I take? How I did start? Watch for upcoming articles üòâ.
