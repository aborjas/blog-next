Hello again! If you are interested in becoming a web developer it is essential to know what **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is, and to understand its semantics well in order to use it correctly.

HTML is used to define the structure and content of a web page, to represent the content of our web pages verbatim. 

When we talk about tags, we refer to opening (<>) and closing (</>) markers, which indicate the meaning of the text between them, which together make up an HTML element.

The opening tags have a series of attributes that may or may not be used, with which certain properties are assigned to the element.


To write HTML code you will need your text editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code) and create your file with the extension .htm or .html.
 
To create your html document you can type a closed exclamation point (!) And press the enter key. You can also write the following:

![alt text](https://adriborjas.com/images/htmlsc.png "html structure")

In the first two lines define the type of document and create the html element with its tag and the lang attribute, with which you indicate the language in which the document is located, then we find the <head> tag where general information such as titles, links to files such as CSS and others with the <title>, <link> and <meta> tags are placed. 

Some tags as <meta> and <img> are exceptions and has no closing tag.

Finally we find the <body> tag  is where you place the general content such as the heading, the sections made up of images, tables, paragraphs, cards, among many things and using a great variety of tags like <header>, <figure>, <section>, <p>, <div>, and others.
