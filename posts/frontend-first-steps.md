### Do you know somthing about Frontend development? let's talk about this!

In the world of **web development** we can find **frontend, backend and fullstack developers**, the latter being able to work with the first two areas. 

Backend developers focus on the **operation** of web pages and everything related to **databases and servers**. What does a frontend developer do? weÂ´ll go deeper in that.

Frontend development handles the **visible part of web pages**. After the web designer has finished his work and has a client-approved design, it's the frontend developer's job to convert it to code, so you can **see and feel** the site in the browser. 

Frontend development is strongly related to web design and in some cases the developer can take over the design or responsive design.
  
### Would you like to be a frontend developer? Well here are the first steps to become one of them:

  1. You must have a **PC or laptop**, this is a fundamental requirement, without an internet PC or laptop you cannot write, analyze and test code.
  
######   *Tip: Take into account that there are procedures that are done in different ways depending on the operating system.*

  2. Download your **text editor**. This will be the tool where you will write your code, whatever programming language you use. **Visual Studio Code**, Sublime Text and Atom are the most popular, the first is the most recommended. 
  
######  *Tip: Make sure to **configure** your text editor with themes, colors, fonts, among others, that help you feel more **comfortable** since you will spend most of your day writing there.*

  3. Learn English and **don't settle for the basics**. Although if you are familiar with the language it will not take much work to code or analyze code, handling it in an advanced way will open doors for you even in higher paying jobs.

  4. Learn **HTML, CSS and JS**. With HTML you create the **content** or elements that make up the web page, such as headers, titles, images and more, while with CSS you apply the **styles** to the elements (font, color, size ...) and finally JavaScript (vanilla) basically to program the **dynamic effects** of the web page. 
  
######  *Tip: Don't try to understand JavaScript perfectly right off the bat. Research on how others use it will be a great help from the beginning.*

  5. Manage the versions of your files with Distributed **Version Control** systems (such as **Git**, Mercurial or Bazaar), this will allow you to record the changes you make and also return to previous versions of your files. It is important to know it is something that you can learn even before learning to program and you can not only use it in this area but also for web designs, photo editing, and files in general.

On the internet you can find a lot of information such as articles, tutorials, courses and if you plan to join the **world of programming** you should know that, as in many careers, you will always need a lot of **practice and research** to keep learning and keep you up to date, which is something super important and it will make the difference between being one of the bunch or being the best. ðŸ˜‰
